<title>New Eclipse JUnit Feature: Run any subtree of tests
	individually</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>In Eclipse, the JUnit view nicely visualizes execution status
		and results of JUnit tests. JUnit tests usually are Java classes with
		test methods or Java classes annotated with @SuiteClasses, which
		compose multiple other test classes or suites.</p>
	<p>
		But JUnit is more powerful than that. It allows you to implement
		custom <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Test-runners"
			target="_blank">test runners</a>. Those test runners are responsible
		for creating a tree structure of test descriptions. Later the runner
		needs to execute all leafs of that tree as test cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		A node in this tree of tests is not necessarily backed by a Java
		class, as it is for test suites. It can be something purely virtual.
		JUnit itself ships with a test runner for which this is true: <a
			href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Parameterized-tests"
			target="_blank"><i>org.junit.runners.Parameterized</i></a>.
	</p>

		The screenshots above shows a <i>Parameterized</i> test on the
		left-hand-side and the Eclipse JUnit View (after the test has been
		executed) on the right-hand-side. The method <i>parameters()</i>
		returns a list of test data sets and the <i>Parameterized</i> runner
		will call the constructor of this test class for each data set.
		Consequently, the number of constructor parameters must match the
		number of items in each data set. For each data set, all test methods
		are executed and what we get, effectively, is a matrix test.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the screenshot of the JUnit view we can see how the <i>Parameterized</i>
		runner presents the test matrix as a tree: The test class itself is
		the root node, every data set is a subtree and every entry of the test
		matrix is a leaf.
	</p>
	<p>
		As of now (Eclipse Mars M4), it is possible to run individual subtrees
		by choosing "run" from the context menu. This effectively means to
		execute a row from the test matrix.
	</p>

	<p>
		Additionally, it is now possible to run a single column from the test
		matrix by running a single method from a <i>Parameterized</i> test.
	</p>
	<img width="800" alt="" src="images/RunMethodAll.png">
	<p>Note that in the picture on the left-hand-side I'm explicitly
		clicking on the method's name. Clicking elsewhere would execute all
		test methods from the class.</p>
	<p>
		The new mechanism to filter down test description trees can achieve
		this without being specific to to JUnit's <i>Parameterized</i> runner:
		The filter first extracts the leading part of the test desription's
		name which is a valid Java identifier. The test is executed if this
		leading part exists and if it equals the to-be-executed method's name.

		I would like to thank <a href="http://www.numberfour.eu/">NumberFour</a>
		for having me implement this fix specifically for <a
			href="http://www.xpect-tests.org">Xpect</a>. Gratitude also goes to <a
			href="http://www.itemis.de">itemis</a>, my employer, who gave me the
		time to generalize and contribute the fix to Eclipse JDT. Also I would
		like to thank the JDT team for <a
			href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=443498#c9">
			accepting the contribution</a>.
