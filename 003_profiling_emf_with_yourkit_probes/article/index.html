<title>Measuring EMF Resource performance with Yourkit Probes</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Yourkit, but I am grateful
		for their free licenses ??? for open source projects. I've been using
		Yourkit for my work on Xtext???/Xtend???.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Improving the performance of an application can be a challenging
		thing to do. As a developer, you usually have some immediate ideas of
		what are the performance bottlenecks. However, as Ed said in his
		presentation ??? at the last EclipseCon NA, "Don't trust yourself,
		don't trust your friends, and don't even trust me."</p>
	<p>I fully approve his message. Why? Experience shows there is
		truth in this statement.</p>
	<p>If trust does't work, we need facts: We need to measure. We need
		to measure how much time execution of our program takes for specific
		tasks. Two tools probably came to your mind when you read this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.lang.System.nanoSeconds(): This simple but useful method
			give you access to a decently precise time stamp at any time. You can
			call this method from your own code and calculate and report the time
			for what every your desire. But there's a catch: You need to modify
			the code, which you sometimes can't do because the code is part of a
			library/framework or you don't want to do it, because it would would
			pollute the code.</li>
		<li>A Profiler (such as Yourkit ???): This powerful tool lets you
			measure measure the execution time of every since method invocation.
			Sounds awesome? Yes, but there are some problems with it:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The "lost in the jungle syndrome": The result of a profiling
				session are a bunch of trees representing all stated of the call
				stack your application had during the profiling session. And just
				like in a jungle, these trees are incredibly huge. Sometimes the
				profiler can point out some performance hot spots, but I think that
				only works well if you have some very obvious performance problems.
				So you end up spending a lot of time climbing through the trees,
				considering for every branch whether its existence and time
				consumption is justified.</li>
			<li>Observing a system changes it: A profiler usually uses a
				java agent, which is a hook in the JVM that allows to manipulate
				class files before they're executed. This way the profiler can
				inject byte code for performance measurements into the
				to-be-analyzed classes. Surely this injected code is small and fast,
				but it can have an impact on how the Java JIT can optimize the byte
				code. Example: A method that could be in-lined before may not be
				in-lined anymore. I don't mind if an application runs slower during
				a profiling session, but I do mind if the times measured during
				profiling are disproportional to the actual times.</li>
			<li>Parameter values are not available: To understand what the
				code is doing, you sometimes need to know the values of the method
				parameters. Consider questions such as: Does a certain value occur
				so often that introducing an early-exit to the method would improve
				the speed? Does the same value occur because the method was
				accidentally called from within a loop? Would it help to cache the
				result of the method?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h2>Probes to the Rescue</h2>
	<p>Yourkit allows you to have so-called Probes. Here are some facts
		in a nutshell:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A probe is a Java class that hooks into the invocation of
			methods of the to-be-analyzed code. Such hooks can be registered to
			be invoked before or after a method has been invoked.</li>
		<li>Installing pre-/post-invocation hooks into methods may sounds
			familiar to you from Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). It's indeed
			the same idea, but unlike in AOP you don't need to a special
			compiler: Yourkit registers the probes at runtime via its Java agent.
			Therefore, probes don't change your build and are applicable for
			already compiled libraries.</li>
		<li>You can use probes independently of CPU profiling
			(sampling/tracing). A probe is active once it has been registered and
			you can choose not to enable CPU profiling at the same time. This may
			safe you from getting the "Observing a system changes it" bias.</li>
		<li>Yourkit ships with a set of predefined probes for standard
			events, such as Tread lifecycles, file system I/O, etc. You can as
			well implement your own probes.</li>
		<li>In a probe's implementation, you can access the hooked
			method's parameter- and return values.</li>
		<li>Youkit encourages you to build a Java data structure for your
			measured data that resembles a relational data base. If you follow
			that pattern, youkit has a nice graphical user interface to explore
			your measured data.</li>
	</ul>
