			href="http://www.xtext.org/">Xtext</a> and <a
			href="http://www.xtend-lang.de/">Xtend</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Improving the performance of an application can be a challenging thing
		to do. As a developer, you usually have some immediate ideas of what
		are the performance bottlenecks. However, as Ed said in <a
			href="his
		presentation">his presentation</a> at EclipseCon North
		America 2013, "Don't trust yourself, don't trust your friends, and
		don't even trust me."
	</p>
	<p>I fully approve his message. Why? Experience shows there is
		truth in this statement.</p>
	<p>If trust does't work, we need facts: We need to measure. We need
		to measure how much time it takes to execute our program for specific
		tasks. Two tools probably come to your mind as you read this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>java.lang.System.nanoSeconds(): This simple but useful method
			gives you access to a decently precise time stamp at any time. You
			can call this method from your own code and calculate and report the
			time for what every your desire. But there's a catch: You need to
			modify the code that you want to inspect, which you sometimes can't
			do because the code is part of a library/framework or you just don't
			want to pollute the code.</li>
		<li>A Profiler (such as <a href="http://www.yourkit.com/">Yourkit</a>):
			This powerful tool lets you measure measure the execution time of
			every since method invocation. Sounds awesome? Yes, but there are
			some problems with it:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The "lost in the jungle syndrome": The result of a profiling
				session are a bunch of trees representing all stated of the call
				stack your application had during the profiling session. And just
				like in a jungle, these trees are incredibly huge. Sometimes the
				profiler can point out some performance hot spots, but I think that
				only works well if you have some very obvious performance problems.
				So you end up spending a lot of time climbing through the trees,
				considering for every branch whether its existence and time
				consumption is justified.</li>
			<li>Observing a system changes it: A profiler usually uses a
				java agent, which is a hook in the JVM that allows to manipulate
				class files before they're executed. This way the profiler can
				inject byte code for performance measurements into the
				to-be-analyzed classes. Surely this injected code is small and fast,
				but it can have an impact on how the Java JIT can optimize the byte
				code. Example: A method that could be in-lined before may not be
				in-lined anymore. I don't mind if an application runs slower during
				a profiling session, but I do mind if the times measured during
				profiling are disproportional to the actual times.</li>
			<li>Parameter values are not available: To understand what the
				code is doing, you sometimes need to know the values of the method
				parameters. Consider questions such as: Does a certain value occur
				so often that introducing an early-exit to the method would improve
				the speed? Does the same value occur because the method was
				accidentally called from within a loop? Would it help to cache the
				result of the method?</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h2>Probes to the Rescue</h2>
	<p>Yourkit allows you to have so-called Probes. Here are some facts
		in a nutshell:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A probe is a Java class that hooks into the invocation of
			methods of the to-be-analyzed code. Such hooks can be registered to
			be invoked before or after a method has been invoked.</li>
		<li>Installing pre-/post-invocation hooks into methods may sounds
			familiar to you from Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). It's indeed
			the same kind of hook, but unlike in AOP you don't need to a special
			compiler: Yourkit registers the probes at runtime via its Java agent.
			Therefore, probes don't change your build and are applicable for
			already compiled libraries.</li>
		<li>You can use probes independently of CPU profiling
			(sampling/tracing). A probe is active once it has been registered and
			you can choose not to enable CPU profiling at the same time. This may
			safe you from getting the "Observing a system changes it" bias.</li>
		<li>Yourkit ships with a set of predefined probes for standard
			events, such as Tread lifecycles, file system I/O, etc. You can as
			well implement your own probes.</li>
		<li>In a probe's implementation, you can access the hooked
			method's parameter- and return values.</li>
		<li>Youkit encourages you to build a Java data structure for your
			measured data that resembles a relational data base. If you follow
			that pattern, Yourkit has a nice graphical user interface to explore
			your measured data.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Probing EMF ResourceSets and Resources</h2>
	<p>
		As an example and for further illustration, I've build a small probe
		that tracks instantiation of EMF ResourceSets and invocation of EMF
		Resources. In the terminology of the <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling
			Framework (EMF)</a> a Resource usually represents a file from the file
		system. A resource furthermore provides implementations to load a file
		into memory as an object tree (aka model) or persist a tree back to
		disk.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following screenshot shows an Eclipse IDE with two open editors.
		One editor shows an <a href="http://www.xtend-lang.org">*.xtend</a>
		file and the other one a *.genmodel. Even though both use EMF under
		the hood, they have little in common:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The *.xtend text-editor shows a file persisted as plain text;
			It's Resource.load() implementation delegates to an ANTLR parser.</li>
		<li>The *.genmodel tree-editor shows the structure of a file that
			is persisted as XML. Here, an XML parser is used.</li>
	</ol>
	<img src="images/emf_genmodel_and_xtend_editor.png" />
	<p>The Yourkit probe was registered while opening both editors. The
		following screenshot shows the measured data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the tree view on the left hand side you can see all
			available probes. The probe "EMF ResourceSets" has been developed by
			me, all others ship with Yourkit. The checkbox does <i>not</i>
			register/unregister the probe. The checkbox shows/hides the data
			measured by the probe in the views on the right-hand side of the
			tree-view.
		</li>
		<li>The table on the top on the right-hand side shows a list of
			all ResourceSets that have been instantiated. The
			AdapterFactoryEditingDomainResourceSet is the one used by the
			*.genmodel editor. As you can see, there was more going on in my
			Eclipse instance before I took the screenshot. A click on the column
			labeled "stack trace" would reveal how a specific ResourceSet has
			been instantiated.</li>
		<li>The table on the bottom right-hand side shows all invocations
			of Resource.load() for the ResourceSet that is selected in the table
			above. Here we can see that tracking of application state is
			possible: The column "uri" displays the file name of the file that
			has been loaded. The "wall time" is the time in milliseconds that was
			spent executing the load() method.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Implementing a Probe</h2>
	<p>
		<i>You can find the full source code of this example <a
			href="https://github.com/meysholdt/blog/tree/master/003_profiling_emf_with_yourkit_probes">here</a>
			on github.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>Before we start implementing a probe, some considerations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The code that the probe hooks into needs to have the probe
			implementation on the classpath. Furthermore, it is helpful if the
			probe has the code it hooks into on the classpath, since otherwise
			the probe implementation would need to use Java reflection to inspect
			the to-be-analyzed object. This sounds tricky since it is in fact a
			cyclic dependency between the probe and the inspected code. Luckily
			Eclipse has a simple mechanism to contribute to a plugin's classapth:
			<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_a_plug-in_fragment%3F">Fragments</a>.
			A fragment is a bundle with class files, own dependencies and
			extension points that at runtime is integrated into the classpath of
			a chosen host-plugin. We choose org.eclipse.emf.ecore to be that
			host-plugin.
		</li>
		<li>Probes need to <a
			href="http://www.yourkit.com/docs/12/help/register_probes.jsp">be
				registered</a>: We could do that by changing the JVM's startup
			arguments, but in an Eclipse environment it seems more convenient to
			use the extension point org.eclipse.ui.startup.
		</li>
		<li>The probe implementation uses <a
			href="http://www.yourkit.com/docs/12/api/index.html">Java API
				provided by Yourkit</a>. This API ca be found in /lib/yjp.jar inside the
			Yourkit installation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The next screenshot shows the the implementation of the probe.
		It is a java class with static members to
	<ul>
		<li>define the data structures for storing the measured values
			(TABLE_RESOURCESET, TABLE_RESOURCE).</li>
		<li>intercept calls to ResourceSet constructors (ResourceSetInit)
			and Resource#load() invocations.</li>
		<li>map ResourceSet-Objects to Table-Row-IDs (rs2row and
			getResourceSetRow()).</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="images/probe_impl_tables.png" />
	<p>Now that you've had an overview over the probe implementation,
		here is finally the core, the actual hooks: Each method-hook is a
		static Java class that can implement the static methods onEnter() and
		onReturn(). Annotations are used for further configuration:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>@MethodPattern specifies the signature of the
			to-be-intercepted method.</li>
		<li>@This gives access to the object on which the method has been
			called.</li>
		<li>@OnEnterResult gives access to the return value of the
			onEnter method.</li>
		<li>@Param(1) gives access to the first parameter of the
			intercepted method.</li>
		<li><a
			href="http://www.yourkit.com/docs/12/help/event_method_call.jsp">etc.</a></li>
	</ul>
	<img src="images/probe_impl_hooks.png" />
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Probes can deliver concise and precise performance
			measurements for an application or a group of applications that are
			based on the same frameworks/libraries.</li>
		<li>Probes have the potential to define reasonable performance
			metrics for specific applications that can be shared across a team of
			developers.</li>
		<li>Probes cause significantly less side-effects compared to
			general profiling.</li>
		<li>Probes can make use of more information than a profiler, such
			as application state, parameter values and return values.</li>
		<li>Implementing probes is some effort. This may be of less
			significance when probes can be reused. However, in scenarios were
			reuse in not intended - for example the explorative search for
			performance issues - their use may be too much effort.</li>
	</ol>
