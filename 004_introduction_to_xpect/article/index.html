	<h1>Introduction to Xpect</h1>
	 <i>Xpect is a framework that helps you to test, discuss, and
  explain Xtext languages.</i>
 <p>
  Before I start, I'd like to tell a bit about me, since it gives a
  context on why I created <a href="http://www.xpect-tests.org">Xpect</a>.
  As you may know, I've been a committer at the Eclipse Xtext project
  since January 2009. Besides working on <a href="http://xtext.org/">Xtext</a>
  (and <a href="http://xtend-lang.org/">Xtend</a>), I have been applying
  this technology in several customer projects: Project sizes varied
  from man days to man years and my role varied between designing a
  language and providing professional support for technical challenges.
 </p>
 <p>All projects have in common that we wanted to develop Xtext
  languages. Sometimes we were free to design syntax and semantics from
  scratch and sometimes we were bound to a language specification. In
  most projects we needed to...</p>
 <ul>
  <li>have automated tests for our language tooling.</li>
  <li>discuss design and implementations decisions.</li>
  <li>explain the language and tooling to fellow developers and
   prospective users.</li>
  <li>allow our implementation to be reviewed regarding
   completeness and correctness. I.e. pass an acceptance test.</li>
  <li>set up test stubs for fellow developers to implement tests.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>To comply with these use cases I found myself writing plenty of
  JUnit tests and creating many example documents of the language, often
  with redundant content. I could not use the JUnit test to explain and
  discuss the language with others, since the Java code was distracting
  them from what I wanted to show. Furthermore, I was annoyed
  that I could not use the language's Xtext editor to craft test data,
  since the test data was embedded in string literals in the test's Java
  code. Also, when I wrote example documents, I found myself inserting
  comments to explain the language: "This expression will evaluate to
  xxx", "This statement causes error yyy", "This cross reference links
  to zzz", etc.</p>
 <p>The idea arose to converge test cases and example documents:
  What if I could embed test expectations within comments inside my
  example documents? What if I could find a format for these comments so
  they're both human understandable and automatically verifiable by a
  test suite?</p>
 <p>
  Xpect realizes this idea. The version introduced by this blog post or
  older versions are actively being used by in-house projects, several
  customer projects, and open source projects such as <a
   href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/emf/org.eclipse.emf.git/tree/tests/org.eclipse.emf.test.ecore.xcore/src/org/eclipse/emf/test/ecore/xcore/validation">Xcore</a>
  and <a
   href="http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/source/browse/tests/org.eclipselabs.spray.styles.tests/model/">Spray</a>.

 <h2>One File, Two Languages</h2>

 <a

 <p>
  What you can see in the screenshot above is a JUnit that has been
  executed and which passed. The test class is <i>org.domainmodel.tests.validation.DMValidationTest</i>
  and it has executed a file named <i>test1.dmodel.xt</i>. The file
  defines two test cases, one called <i>warnings</i> and one called <i>errors</i>.
  On the right hand side you can see the file's contents in an editor.
  The editor generically combines support for two languages: First, the
  language that is being tested. In the screenshot this is the
  Domainmodel language (*.dmodel) which ships with Xtext as an example
  language. Secondly, the editor supports the Xpect language (*.xt). The
  two languages do not interfere with each other since the Domainmodel
  language ignores text insides comments and the Xpect language ignores
  text that doesn't start with an "XPECT" keyword. The editor applies a
  greenish background color to Xpect syntax.
 </p>

 <p>
  Let's take a closer look at the Xpect syntax. At the beginning of
  <i>test1.dmodel.xt</i>, there is a region called
  <span style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0; color: #931a68">XPECT_SETUP</span>.
  It holds a reference to the JUnit test that can run this file. Further down we find test cases such as:
 </p>

 <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font: 11.0px Monaco; color: #4e9072">// capitalized property names are discouraged</p>
 <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font: 11.0px Monaco"><span style="color: #4e9072;">// </span><span style="background-color: #c5f9e0; color: #931a68">XPECT</span> warnings --&gt; <span style="background-color: #c5f9e0;">"Name should start with a lowercase" at "Property1"</span></p>
 <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font: 11.0px Monaco">Property1 : String</p>
 <p>
  The first line is an optional title for the test. <i>warnings</i>
  references a JUnit test method (implemented in Java) and the part
  following the <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i>--&gt;</i></span> is the test expectation, which is passed
  as a parameter into the JUnit test method. The test method can then
  compare the test expectation with what it calculated to be the actual
  test value and pass or fail accordingly. For this example, the test
  expectation is composed of the error/warning message (<span
   style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0;">Name
   should start with a lowercase</span>) and the text that would be underlined
  by the red curly line in the editor (<span
   style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0;">Property1</span>).
  For this validation test, the <span
   style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0; color: #931a68">XPECT</span>
  statement collects all errors or warning occurring in the next line.
  A feature you might find very useful is, that the
  <span
   style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0; color: #931a68">XPECT</span>
  statement <i>consumes</i> error or warning markers: An expected error
  or warning will
  <i>not</i> be shown as an error marker in the Eclipse editor.
 </p>
 
 
 <h2>Synchronize Expectations and Implementation</h2>

 <p>The fact that Xpect uses textual expectations and embeds them
  into DSL documents opens the door for another awesome (IMHO) feature:
  Using the Eclipse comparison editor to inspect failed tests and to fix
  out-dated test expectations:</p>

 <a
  href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dsFfA6vC70g/UiX2lqluC3I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/0Ms4Fhh7UmM/s1600/xpect_test_failure.png"><img

  src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dsFfA6vC70g/UiX2lqluC3I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/0Ms4Fhh7UmM/s870/xpect_test_failure.png" /></a>


 <p>
  When one or more tests fail and you want to fix them, it is crucial to quickly
  get an overview over all failed tests. With Xpect you can not
  only see all failed test cases from one file in a single comparison
  editor, but there are also no assert statements which sometimes
  prevent execution of follow-up assert statements and thereby hide valuable hints on why the test failed. The comparison
  editor, as the name suggests, also lets you edit the test file.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Reusable Test Library</h2>
 <p>
  In Xtext projects, there are several scenarios where it is reasonable to have test coverage. The validation test I explained
  earlier in this article is just one of these scenarios. Xpect ships the
  Java-part for such tests <a
   href="https://github.com/meysholdt/Xpect/tree/master/org.xpect.xtext.lib/src/org/xpect/xtext/lib/tests">as
   a library</a>. There is also an <a
   href="https://github.com/meysholdt/Xpect/tree/master/org.eclipse.xtext.example.domainmodel.xpect.tests/src/org/eclipse/xtext/example/domainmodel/xpect/tests">example
   project</a> that demonstrates their usage.
 </p>
 <p>There are test for:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The parser and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure (demo only, no library).</li>
  <li>Code generators implemented via Xtext's IGenerator interface.</li>
  <li>Validation: Test for absence, presence, message and location of errors and warnings.</li>
  <li>Linking: Verify a cross reference resolved to the intended model element</li>
  <li>Scoping: Verify the expected names are included or excluded from a cross references's scope.</li>
  <li>ResourceDescriptions: Verify a document exports the intended model elements with proper names.</li>
  <li>JvmModelInferrer: For languages using Xbase, test the inferred JVM model</li>
 </ul>
 <p>There will be more tests in future versions of Xpect.</p>
 
 
 <h2>Support for Standalone and Workspace Tests</h2>
 <p>UI-independent parts of Xtext, such as the parser, can operate
  standalone (i.e. without OSGi and Eclipse Workspace). The same is true
  for Xpect. For capabilities where Xtext does not require OSGi or an
  Eclipse Workspace, Xpect does not do so either. Consequently, Xpect
  tests can be executed as plain JUnit test or Plug-In JUnit tests.</p>

 <p>
  Since both scenarios require different kinds of setups, both can be
  configured separately in the <span
   style="font: 11.0px Monaco; background-color: #c5f9e0; color: #931a68">XPECT_SETUP</span>
  section. When executed as plain JUnit test, the
  ResourceSet-configuration is used and for Plug-In JUnit tests, the
  Workspace-Configuration is used.
 </p>

<a

  src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2rqhU60jnRk/UiX2kyQWQhI/AAAAAAAAAJo/sCrzUqvb-VQ/s700/xpect_setup.png" /></a>

 <p>The screenshot also illustrates how an additional file can be
  loaded so that it is included in the current ResourceSet or Workspace during
  test execution.</p>

 <h2>Suites: Combine Tests in the Same File</h2>

 <p>When explaining a specific concept of a language, it is helpful
  to look at the language concept from all sides: This is the valid
  syntax, these scenarios are disallowed, this is how cross references
  resolve, this is how it is executed, etc. So far, testers were
  required to create a new test file for every technical aspect. With
  Xpect test suites, however, it is possible to combine the Java-parts
  of various tests into a single test suite.</p>

<a
  href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-urTT8gnk02Q/UiX2k_gFoPI/AAAAAAAAAJs/QNf81p8whe8/s1600/xpect_suite.png"><img

  src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-urTT8gnk02Q/UiX2k_gFoPI/AAAAAAAAAJs/QNf81p8whe8/s800/xpect_suite.png" /></a>


 <p>
  The test suite <i>XtextTests</i> combines several tests so that in <i>CombiningMultipleTests.dmodel.xt</i>
  test methods from all these tests can be used. This allows to group
  tests by language concept.
 </p>


 <h2>Works with CI Builds</h2>

 <p>Xpect tests have proven to run fine with Maven, Tycho, Surefire,
  Buckminster and Jenkins. No special integration is necessary since
  Xpect tests run as JUnit tests.</p>
